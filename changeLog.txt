-Append Active Player List with starting user
-Sort homepage game list into game status
-Started building single game page
-Started building join function
-Games the player is not in currently allow options to join on character
-Also prevents players from joining on games in progress
-Fixed addChar function within the Game class to append active player list and add userID to appropriate character field
-addChar can now recognize functions inputting all lowercase last name, Capitalized last name, and Mr. Lastname character names

Future changes:
-Make homepage only accessible to users signed in
-If the user is signed in, change any links to the login feature to be a log out link
-Dont allow signed in user to manually enter the login page
-Also add login form to any page in the side banner
-Maybe consider letting the /login page only be a POST method, and allow redirects based on input, forcing no one to be able to enter it manually
