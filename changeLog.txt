-Built the MAMP database
-Successfully started a "game" through HTML
-Successfully added a first "character" automatically to a new game
-Successfully tied games to a logged in player
-Successfully displayed games to a logged in player
-Built templates to accommodate new features, signin, new game, homepage, etc. 



Future changes:
-Make homepage only accessible to users signed in
-If the user is signed in, change any links to the login feature to be a log out link
-Dont allow signed in user to manually enter the login page
-Also add login form to any page in the side banner
-Maybe consider letting the /login page only be a POST method, and allow redirects based on input, forcing no one to be able to enter it manually
